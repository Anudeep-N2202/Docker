					Voting App
For this application we will use the Docker Example Voting App. This app consists of five components:
Python webapp which lets you vote between two options
Redis queue which collects new votes
.NET worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
Postgres database backed by a Docker volume
Node.js webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time
